We first read everything 
Are you ready to begin? 
Answer : Let's Go!

Task 2 : TIP-OFF 
By reading the message we immediatly understand that we need to download the image from the github then use exiftool on it
And then we see this :

We see some very interesting information which is : /home/SakuraSnowAngelAiko/Desktop/

What username does the attacker go by? 
Answer : SakuraSnowAngelAiko

Task 3 : Reconnaissance
Thanks to the instructions we know that we just need to search for username, there are several online tools out there such as : https://instantusername.com/#/

But i will use sherlock : 
sherlock SakuraSnowAngelAiko                  
[*] Checking username SakuraSnowAngelAiko on:

[+] Enjin: https://www.enjin.com/profile/SakuraSnowAngelAiko
[+] GitHub: https://www.github.com/SakuraSnowAngelAiko
[+] Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/SakuraSnowAngelAiko

We look at each one :
enjin : The first one is obviously a false positive after checking it
GitHub : We found him !!!
Reddit : We'll look at it later
We see a very interesting repo which is PGP
A PGP key is a public encryption key. A PGP key can be used to sign and encrypt emails and files. When you create a PGP key, a keypair having a public key and a private key is generated.
We click on it
then download the public key
We then use gpg to get the fingerprint and get the email : 
gpg --with-fingerprint publickey 
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
pub   rsa3072 2021-01-23 [SC] [expired: 2023-01-22]
uid           SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com
sub   rsa3072 2021-01-23 [E] [expired: 2023-01-22]

What is the full email address used by the attacker?
Answer : SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com


After that i went looking on several search engines other accounts
and found in google a twitter account : https://twitter.com/sakuraloveraiko

Great we found the name : Aiko
But it's not enough, we look at the replies and found out that she introduced herself : 

Aiko
@SakuraLoverAiko
·
Jan 30, 2021
Silly me, I forgot to introduce myself!
Hi there! I'm @AikoAbe3!

Of course there is more information, but let's leave that for later. First let's finish this task by answering the last question of this task.


What is the attacker's full real name?
Answer : Aiko Abe

Task 4 : UNVEIL 
Let's dive in the user github account again :
We look at the repository and we find ETH, which is very promising
because we know that the others are just miners so we can ignore them for now and focus on this repository which is an ethereum wallet. We can now answer the first question.

What cryptocurrency does the attacker own a cryptocurrency wallet for?
Answer : Ethereum

We see that there were a commit before so we click on histroy and look at the update miningscript and we find some crucial information : an ethereum wallet address. We can answer know the second question. 

What is the attacker's cryptocurrency wallet address?
Answer : 0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef

We know that ethereum is a cryptocurrency and we know that cryptocurrency operate in the blockchain so we can find all transactions made by any wallet address. Therefore we use : https://etherscan.io/
Then input in the search bar the wallet address and we see there are a total of 40 transactions found : https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef
We look at the column From and we find : Ethermine. Great we can answer the third question.

What mining pool did the attacker receive payments from on January 23, 2021 UTC?
Answer : ethermine

Finally if we just click on show all transactions and go to the bottom we see that there are some outgoing transactions and they are USDT which is Tether. We can now answer the last question of this task.

What other cryptocurrency did the attacker exchange with using their cryptocurrency wallet?
Answer : Tether

Task5 : TAUNT
We recognize that @AikoAbe3 is the twitter account that we already found earlier. So we go into her twitter acccount again. We can immediatly answer the first question with the handle we got.

What is the attacker's current Twitter handle?
Answer : @SakuraLoverAiko

Next i just typed the md5 hash on goolge and then i got an image with the url of the website. But actually it was the hint from tryhackme for this question. Anyways so i just bacially to the image yo yandex then i got the url and i added the md5 hash to it so we can answer the question.


What is the URL for the location where the attacker saved their WiFi  SSIDs and passwords?
Answer : deepv2w7p33xa4pwxzwi2ps4j62gfxpyp44ezjbmpttxz3owlsp4ljid.onion/show.php?md5=b2b37b3c106eb3f86e2340a3050968e2

In the hint from tryhackme image we can see in Home Wifi : DK1F-G with
So we can use a very google OSINT tool for wifi BSSID which is wigle.net
We click on advanced search, we login then we type the wifi SSID we got in the required box and hit query : https://wigle.net/search?ssid=DK1F-G We then get : 
SSID: DK1F-G
BSSID: 84:AF:EC:34:FC:F8
First Time: 2019-04-24T11:00:00.000Z
Last Time: 2019-05-02T05:00:00.000Z
Channel: 11
Encryption: wpa2
Quality of Signal: 0
Address: , 弘前市, 青森県, JP, 036-8207
We can answer now the last question for this task.

What is the BSSID for the attacker's Home WiFi?
Answer : 84:AF:EC:34:FC:F8

Task 6 : 
First we look at the sakura tree, we look at the countries in the world having a sakura tree, so we type in google : countries that has a sakura tree with a lake on the right
We immediatly see an image similar to the one we have, we click on it : 
https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/lifestyle/travel/best-places-for-cherry-blossoms-around-the-world-besides-japan-in-spring-2022/
It says 7 other countries beside Japan has one, great we scroll down and then we immediatly see : Washington, D.C, USA we the monument in the background the exact same we have. We could easily see that it was in washington, anyways. Then we google the closest airport to the monument in washington dc : closest airport to washington dc monument
We click on this link : https://www.travelmath.com/nearest-airport/Washington+Monument
We can see that the closest airport is  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA / KDCA)
We can know answer the first question of this task.

What airport is closest to the location the attacker shared a photo from prior to getting on their flight?
Answer : DCA

Then after looking at the next image, we type in google : Jal first class lounge sakura lounge japan, because we know that she wants to get to japan. We click on this : https://www.jal.co.jp/jp/en/inter/service/lounge/
We find two different airport with First class lounge and sakura lounge which are : Haneda and Narita airport. So we look at the images of each one of them by typing on google : narita first class lounge entrance image
We find this image for narita first class lounge : https://knaviation.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JAL-First-Class-Lounge-Tokyo-Narita-2.jpg
Which is obviously not the one we have. So it must be the other airport. But to be sure let's look at the other airport lounge image : haneda first class lounge entrance image 
We find this image for haneda first class lounge : 
https://everybodyhatesatourist.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jal-first-class-lounge-tokyo-haneda-entrance-700x525.jpg
We then look in wikipedia the 3 digits for the aiport haneda which is Code IATA	: HND
Great we can answer the question.

What airport did the attacker have their last layover in?
Answer : HND

Then we continue looking at the next image, which is a map and we want to know what is the name of the lake. We can do that by reproducing the exact same map image using google earth and then finding the lake by clicking on it, and we get it easly : https://earth.google.com/web/search/japan/@37.67293173,139.72976304,666.21817115a,339191.84430588d,35y,8.48901987h,0t,0r/data=CigiJgokCZl1pK6ce0NAEUHXgUEvcENAGaBrFDOeQFPAIVLeDsWQRVPA
We can now just zoom into the lake till we see it's name : 
https://earth.google.com/web/search/japan/@37.49121853,140.10047896,511.47336559a,11047.05351844d,35y,8.69809888h,0t,0r/data=CigiJgokCZl1pK6ce0NAEUHXgUEvcENAGaBrFDOeQFPAIVLeDsWQRVPA
We see the name, so we can answer the question.

What lake can be seen in the map shared by the attacker as they were on their final flight home?
Answer : Lake Inawashiro

For the last question we must not forget that when we got the BSSID earlier in the task 4 we got the street where the wifi is : https://wigle.net/map?maplat=40.604706600748074&maplon=140.4603438290878&mapzoom=18&netid=84%3Aaf%3Aec%3A34%3Afc%3Af8&coloring=density 
So by zooming out we can see a park with the name Fujita Kinen Teien very close to his house. So we just need to find the city name of this park which is given to use by google maps : https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Fujita+Memorial+Garden/@40.6048185,140.4604643,18.3z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5f9b01dccd96aaab:0x322b3efbf3b4f108!8m2!3d40.6042254!4d140.4602668!16s%2Fg%2F121pksbk
And that concludes this amazing room.

What city does the attacker likely consider "home"?
Answer : Hirosaki
